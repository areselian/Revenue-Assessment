# SQL-Assignment

The Michael J Fox Foundation continually seeks novel ways of engaging its constituents. Ever proactive, teams experiment with new marketing campaigns, content, and segmentation. For instance, in 2013, the donation threshold for assigning a donor to a relationship manager was lowered from $2500 to a $1000 in hopes of strengthening donor loyalty and increasing revenue. Once assigned, the donor receives personalized messaging and speaks with a relationship manager on the phone or in-person.
 
The Data Analyst is charged with assessing the effectiveness of this strategy. The attached data set contains anonymized donation records from 2010-2017 to help your analysis. In 2-3 slides, please describe your methodology, results, and recommendations. Feel free to use any tools, programs, statistical and data mining techniques at your disposal.
 
Good luck and have fun!


Strategy – 

Place donors in groups $0-1000, $1000-2500, $2500-the rest; 
Donation’s amount was lowered to $1000 from $2500 in 2013. 
1.	How many people donated $1000 or $2500 and up in 2012? 2013? Did the number increase? 
2.	Did the total revenue amount change for the years? By how much? 2014?

Create a summary table with – 

1.	Total revenue per year 
2.	Percent Change in Revenue per year 
3.	Total number of donors and gifts per year. (Are they the same donors as previous year?)
4.	Number or Pct of accounts that increased per year
5.	Number or Pct of accounts decreased annually 
6.	Number/Percent of accounts didn’t give that year 

We need to select accounts that donated in 2013 (= 1000) and donated in 2014 more or less or nothing

How many accounts donated one year and then next = 0?
How many accounts didn’t donate one year and then donated next year. 

Recommendations: 

First Time Donor –
Continuing Donor – 
In addition to relationship manager interaction, create a membership program based on the amount donors donated allowing MJFF to create a community based around philanthropy, fundraising, and education on the PD. Different size donations can unlock different membership perks. 

Improve Donor Retention – encourage donors to speak up
